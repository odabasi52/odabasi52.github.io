I am passionate about OT security, cybersecurity research, and cloud computing. My work involves security vulnerabilities, offensive security techniques, and ICS security techniques. I actively participate in CTFs, explore network security, and document security risks and mitigation strategies.
 
This blog is where I share insights on cybersecurity, cloud computing, offensive security and many more.
