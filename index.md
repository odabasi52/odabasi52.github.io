I'm passionate about OT security, cybersecurity research, and cloud computing, with a strong focus on identifying security vulnerabilities and exploring offensive security techniques. My work spans industrial control systems (ICS) security, IoT security, and penetration testing. I actively engage in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and continuously explore network security challenges. Through this blog, I share insights on cybersecurity, cloud technologies, offensive security strategies, and practical mitigation techniques to address evolving security risks.
