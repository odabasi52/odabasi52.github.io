# Return - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
The Nmap scan revealed open ports for SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos, which strongly suggests that the target is a Domain Controller. Additionally, an HTTP port was also found to be open.

### WEB
Web enumeration revealed a settings page that allowed updating the server IP address for the printer service. This service was communicating over cleartext LDAP.

## Exploitation
### LDAP Pass-Back Attack
From there, it was straightforward. I followed the guide in [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ldap-pass-back-attack-simple-guide-jose-pacheco-eejkf/) and successfully carried out an LDAP Pass-Back Attack.
I started a listener and updated the server IP with my own. As a result, I was able to capture the cleartext login credentials using Wireshark.

## Privilege Escalation
### Server Operators Group
Privilege escalation was straightforwardâ€”the current service account was a member of the Server Operators group. I leveraged this by updating the binpath of the VMware Tools service (which runs with SYSTEM privileges) to execute nc.exe. After starting a listener and restarting the service, I received a SYSTEM shell. (Followed [this post](https://www.hackingarticles.in/windows-privilege-escalation-server-operator-group/))
