# Keeper - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial NMAP scan revealed  SSH, HTTP ports are open.

### WEB Enumeration
Visiting the HTTP website revealed a domain, so I added it to hosts file.

Searching "request tracker default credentials" on the internet revealed a root credential and I logged in to the website.

## Exploitation
Inside the website under Admin -> Users -> Select, there was a user other than the root.

Clicking to it, and analyzing it revealed default password for that user.

So I simply logged in using SSH.

## Privilege Escalation
On the user's home directory, there was a zipped file. Inside of it there was keepass dump and kdbx file.

<img width="670" height="276" alt="06 - rt3000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c615b4ec-c0b4-47ae-a22e-7cbf0758a13c" />

So I transfered those files to my computer using scp and started analyzing it.

### CVE-2023-32784
This version of keepass was vulnerable to [CVE-2023-32784](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32784) which can be explained as "In KeePass 2.x before 2.54, it is possible to recover the cleartext master password from a memory dump".

So at first I tried to dump password with [this](https://github.com/z-jxy/keepass_dump) tool but could not dump. Then I used [keepass-dump-extractor](https://crates.io/crates/keepass-dump-extractor) to extract a wordlist.

<img width="1384" height="167" alt="07 - create keepass list from dumps" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e12c39e-c67c-4c0c-855a-a11be90e5675" />

Then using the wordlist I cracked the kdbx file.

After cracking it I tried to login with keepass2 but it did not work because password had some non-unicode characters. So I used kpcli to login.

<img width="578" height="146" alt="09 - kpcli login" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f570a9b-f418-4d3b-8f93-9ab9477bbd8c" />

Inside the kpcli we can use commands like cd, ls. Some enumeration revealed two ticket files. 

I can run show -f <number> to show the record. The first record revealed Putty SSH key inside it.

<img width="780" height="655" alt="10 -ticket file" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b27f779-10b5-44be-a5cc-a2e7754619ad" />

So at first I downloaded putty-tools then run the command puttygen to create a openssh key "id_rsa" from the PuTTy key.

Then using that key I got the root.

## Pwned
The machine was pwned.
