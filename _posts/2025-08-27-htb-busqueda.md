# Busqueda - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial Nmap scan revealed SSH and HTTP ports open.

### Hosts Update
The HTTP requests were forwarded to searcher.htb so I added it to /etc/hosts file.

## Exploitation
### Searchor Version
The searchor version in use was vulnerable to remote code execution. I used the exploit in [this](https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection) github link.

### Got The User
User was compromised.

## Privilege Escalation
I tried some privilege escalation methods, tried some known exploits against this version but none of them worked. Then I ran linpeas and checked its output which revealed new subdomain gitea.

Then inside the web root, I found a .git directory and config file inside it. It included clear text password of a user named cody. Cody was not available in the current linux, so I tested the password against the current svc user and got the SSH shell.

### sudo -l
Inside the SSH shell I ran sudo -l and found out I can run python3 with a specific script.

<img width="1409" height="148" alt="009 - sudo -l" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6583ae05-1133-41b5-8b1e-0e6b280f95a1" />

The script included 3 options. I used one of the options to check configurations for gitea.

### Gitea
The output included gitea user and password. I used this password with administrator user to login to gitea page.

Now, I got access to the administrator repositories. The scripts repo included the file I can run as sudo. At first I tried to update the file but it was disallowed. Then I checked the file and found out the full-checkup option on the script run ./full-checkup.sh, this can be exploited because it is not using full path.

<img width="569" height="240" alt="013 - update" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a278f92c-9580-409b-ae56-0bb783d34567" />

I created a full-checkup.sh script which creates reverse shell.

Then running the full-checkup option as sudo I got the netcat shell.

## Pwned
The machine was fully pwned.
