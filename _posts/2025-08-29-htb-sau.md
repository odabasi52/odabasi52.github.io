# Sau - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial Nmap scan revealed SSH and port 55555 open.

### Web Enumeration
The target website is request-baskets v1.2.1 which is vulnerable to CVE-2023-27163 (SSRF).

Searching through the Website revealed a [public exploit](https://github.com/madhavmehndiratta/CVE-2023-27163) on github.

Exploiting the target website revealed a internal website which is Maltrail v0.53

## Exploitation
### RCE
The internal website is Maltrail v0.53 which is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. Some research revealed [this](https://securitylit.medium.com/exploiting-maltrail-v0-53-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-rce-66d0666c18c5) post which includes a PoC.

Running the exploit got me reverse shell.

## Privilege Escalation
### sudo -l
Initially I did some enumeration to escalate my privileges. The "sudo -l" command revealed I can run systemctl status for trail.service .

Luckily there was a [GTFOBins page](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/) for systemctl. There were 3 ways to exploit systemctl for privilege escalation. Mine was the third one. The status command opens a less page, so I can simply type !sh to get a root shell.

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.
