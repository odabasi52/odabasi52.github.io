# CozyHosting - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap 
Initial nmap scan revealed HTTP and SSH ports were open.

### Web Enumeration
The web request was forwarded to cozyhosting.htb, so I added it to /etc/hosts file.

Then I applied standard directory brute forcing and found an error page.

<img width="1250" height="312" alt="02 - spring boot error page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6665ba5a-32b5-40c6-b318-d74fe03100cf" />

Searching this page revealed that this was a spring boot application.

Then I applied directory brute forcing with the spring boot specific wordlists and found a valid endpoint named actuator.

This endpoint included some URLs.

The actuator/sessions path contained some valid session cookies.

Then I passed the session cookie and logged in as the kanderson user.

## Exploit
### Command Injection
The wabsite included executessh functionality. At first I tried some command injection methods and it did not work. Later I understood that it was avoiding whitespaces. So I encoded a tab (\t) and it worked. The ${IFS} also works to avoid whitespaces.

Then I created a reverse shell payload and got a reverse shell.

After the initial connection, I was in app directory which included a JAR file. I transfered that file to my machine, and unzipped it.

The file was spring boot application's JAR file. Later, I did some research and found that application.properties file includes some configurations related to the web app. So I checked that file and found a database and its password.

Then using 'psql' command with the necessary parameteres, I got an interactive PostgreSQL shell. Checking the tables revealed the users table.

And the users table included hashed passwords of users.

Then I cracked admin hash with hashcat and rockyou.txt wordlist.

Then used this password to login with SSH and got the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation
The user could run SSH with sudo privileges. The [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ssh/) included sudo ssh privilege escalation. I simply applied the necessary steps and got the root.

## Pwned
The machine was pwned.
