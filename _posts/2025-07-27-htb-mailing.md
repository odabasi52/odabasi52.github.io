# Mailing - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial Nmap scan revealed that SMTP, IMAP, POP3 SMTPs, HTTP and SMB ports are open.

### WEB Enumeration
I applied directory and vhost brute forcing which did not reveal any useful information. 

Then while checking the website I found that there is a 'download.php' file which downloads any file that is given on file parameter. So this endpoint has file disclosure vulnerability. 

I know that the website is using hMailServer, so I simply searched for hMailServer config file location and tried to access it which revealed MD5 Hash of the administrator.

### Crack The Hash
Then using crackstation, I cracked the administrator hash.

## Exploitation
### SMTP 
Using administrator credentials, I tried to login SMTP server and it worked.

### CVE-2024-21413
Now I know the target is windows and it is using mail server. So I simply searched for Windows Mailing Exploits and found an [RCE exploit](https://github.com/xaitax/CVE-2024-21413-Microsoft-Outlook-Remote-Code-Execution-Vulnerability). 
It is a vulnerability occurs from improper input validation on file protocol.

So we need to craft a mail with malicious file URL and capture the NTLMv2 Hash with responder. Below are the names that are found form website. Instructions.pdf reveals mail format 'maya@mailing.htb'. So using below names we can send each one of them a malicious mail.

<img width="1892" height="148" alt="06 - send" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079636af-ced0-43ea-aa62-2b7f4fd84066" />

The maya was the one that opened the mail.

### Crack The Hash
So simply cracked the maya's hash.

### Got The User
Maya had permission to PSRemote so using 'evil-winrm', I got the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation
### Libre Office
Libre office had vulnerable version running.

<img width="1888" height="365" alt="10 - libre version" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84d3ba52-0fe6-48e5-9975-09a61e835af4" />

So searching through internet reveals that this version can allow users to run commands with a maliciously crafted odt file. I created a file that runs nc64.exe and put it in 'Important Documents' folder, where maya had write permissions over SMB.

### Got The Administrator Shell
Then started netcat listener, after a while I got the administrator shell.

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.
