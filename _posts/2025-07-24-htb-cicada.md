### Rid Brute
Because SMB Null session was enabled for IPC$ we could apply rid brute forcing then create a user list.

## Exploitation
### Brute Force
Using the user list and default password, I applied a brute force for SMB login and got a valid user.

### LDAP Search
Then using the found credentials, I ran an ldapsearch and found a password on description field.

### SMB Enumeration
The new user had access to Dev shares which included a backup script. Inside the backup script there was a credentials.

<img width="479" height="233" alt="07 - got the emily" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80f6edca-1ce1-4aa4-9f19-0111a49c6391" />

### WinRM
This user had PSRemote privileges so I simply used evil-winrm and got a shell.

## Privilege Escalation
### SeBackupPrivilege
The user had SeBackupPrivilege enabled.

So I simply followed [this](https://github.com/k4sth4/SeBackupPrivilege) steps and got the Administrator hash.

And then using the psexec I simply got the shell.

## Pwned
The machine was fully pwned.
