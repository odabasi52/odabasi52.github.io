# Monteverde - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Nmap scan results showed services like LDAP and Kerberos, which are commonly used in Active Directory. This indicates the target is likely a Domain Controller.

### SMB Shares
Initially, no SMB shares were accessible via a null session.

### LDAP Anonymous
LDAP anonymous access was enabled, allowing me to enumerate and dump all available users for potential brute-force or further authentication testing.

None of the enumerated users were vulnerable to AS-REP roasting.

### Brute Force
To proceed, I created a custom password list using variations such as reversed usernames, direct usernames, and blank passwords.

I then used Kerbrute with the generated password list to identify valid username-password combinations.

## Exploitation
Although this user couldn't obtain a shell, they had access to certain SMB shares, one of which contained an azure.xml file revealing the cleartext credentials for the user mhope.

Using the credentials from the azure.xml file, I successfully obtained a shell as the user mhope.

![08 - got the user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/039253c4-e4eb-4f96-ba81-1404a81e6b08)

## Privilege Escalation
To escalate privileges, I performed Active Directory enumeration using BloodHound.

![09 - bloodhound python](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26528998-bb56-456b-bebc-2dedbc7c6173)

The BloodHound analysis revealed that the mhope user was a member of the Azure Admins group.

At that point, I was unsure how to proceed, so I researched privilege escalation techniques related to the Azure Admins group. During this process, I came across the following blog post: https://blog.xpnsec.com/azuread-connect-for-redteam/, which provided valuable insights into exploiting Azure AD Connect for privilege escalation.

While reviewing the blog, I learned that the administrator password could be retrieved from the MSSQL ADSync database. I then checked whether I could execute SQL commands using sqlcmd and confirmed that this was possible.

![11 - some sqlcmd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50fbf296-fa9f-46cb-960c-742da21a7efb)

The blog included a script to retrieve keyset_id, instance_id, and entropy from the mms_server_configuration table, as well as private_configuration_xml and encrypted_configuration from the mms_management_agent table. 
These values are then used with functions from C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\mcrypt.dll to decrypt the encrypted administrator password.
However, since the SQL connection in the script was configured for a remote database, I modified it to connect locally by changing this part:
```powershell
$client = new-object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection -ArgumentList "Data Source=(localdb)\.\ADSync;Initial Catalog=ADSync"
```

to this:
```powershell
$client = new-object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection -ArgumentList "Server=localhost;Database=ADSync;Trusted_Connection=True;"
```
For more information about ArgumentList you can checkout this site: https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server/

I then successfully retrieved the decrypted administrator password and used it to log in as the administrator.

![13 - got the root](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35a2cdf4-1179-439b-88a1-2d7969bad4ce)

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.
