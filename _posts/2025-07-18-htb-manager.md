# Manager - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial Nmap scan revealed HTTP, SMB, LDAP, Kerberos, MSSQL and WinRM Ports.

### RID Brute Forcing
I tried anonymous ldapsearch and SMB null session which did not reveal anything. Then I did vhost and directory enumeration for HTTP site and it also did not reveal anything.

Then after some search, I found that it is possible to brute force RIDs if the SMB Null session has read access to IPC$. So I did that and created a userList

## Exploitation
### Brute Force 
Then using the userList, I created an password list that includes reverse and direct usernames.

Then using this credentials I applied a brute force attack for SMB. (At first I tried it with kerbrute which did not reveal anything useful)

### MSSQL Client
After finding the valid password I checked SMB Shares but non of the shares were usefull. So then I tried to login MSSQL with 'mssqlclient.py' using windows-auth option and got inside.

I then tried xp_cmdshell which was blocked. Used xp_dirtree to capture hash with responder but it was a machine account so I could not do anything useful. 

Then again using xp_dirtree I simply enumerated the files. I got access to the inetpub folder and enumerating it I found website backup zip file.

### Got The User
So simply downloaded it and checked all files including hidden files. One of them revealed the password for the user raven.

And using evil-winrm I got the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation
I then used bloodhound and winPEAS but could not find anything useful. Only useful information was network listening service certsrv. 

So I thought maybe the machine is about AD certifications. I then ran certipy.

The machine was vulnerable to ESC7 vulnerability.

So by following the [official wiki](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation) I was able to get administrator hash. And logged in using psexec.py

## Pwned
The machine was pwned.
