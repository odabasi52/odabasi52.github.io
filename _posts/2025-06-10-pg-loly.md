# Loly - OffSec Proving Grounds

## Objective
Employ enumeration, web enumeration, and WordPress enumeration techniques to identify vulnerabilities. Engage in exploiting file upload vulnerabilities and implement privilege escalation strategies. Additionally, utilize kernel exploits to enhance your access. This lab is designed to capitalize on your skills in vulnerability exploitation.

## Enumeration
### Nmap
During the initial reconnaissance phase, an Nmap scan was conducted, revealing the presence of one open port on the target system: Port 80 (HTTP). These findings were noted for further analysis in subsequent phases of the assessment.

### Web Enumeration
During web enumeration, a WordPress site was discovered; however, it was redirecting to the domain loly.lc. To bypass this redirection and access the wp-admin page locally, I added the target IP address to the /etc/hosts file with the domain loly.lc.

### WordPress Enumeration

After gaining access to the WordPress site, I performed a WordPress scan and identified active usernames. I then conducted a brute-force attack using the rockyou.txt wordlist, which successfully yielded valid login credentials. Using these credentials, I was able to access the WordPress admin panel.

## Exploitation
The AdRotate plugin installed on the WordPress site was found to be vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. I generated a PHP reverse shell, compressed it into a ZIP archive, and uploaded it via the plugin's interface. Upon upload, the plugin automatically extracted the archive and placed its contents into the wp-content/banners directory. By navigating to the uploaded PHP file via the browser, I was able to trigger the reverse shell and gain remote access to the target system.

## Privilege Escalation

Initial privilege escalation attempts using the www-data user were unsuccessful. I then attempted kernel exploits, as the target system was running an outdated Linux kernel. However, the exploits failed to compile due to a gcc: cc1: error, indicating that the system lacked a working C compiler or I did not have permission to use it. After further investigation, I discovered valid credentials for the loly user within the wp-config.php file, which allowed me to escalate privileges by switching to that user.

After switching to the loly user, I retried compiling the kernel exploit, and it worked successfully under this user context. Executing the compiled exploit granted root access to the target system.
