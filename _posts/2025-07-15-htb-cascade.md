# Cascade - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
The Nmap scan revealed open ports for SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos, which strongly suggests that the target is a Domain Controller.

### LDAP Anonymous
Anonymous LDAP was enabled, so using ldapsearch did anonymous search which revealed list of users. Then using kerbrute validated them.

<img width="1392" height="61" alt="01 - anon ldap userList" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aabdfeda-b14d-4a9c-ab1c-85dd01b8e35a" />

<img width="1267" height="499" alt="02 - valid users" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b2a9cb2-8b12-4538-a5a4-53cb2275f512" />

Did some brute force but got nothing. Then returned to the ldapsearch and tried to grep 'passw', 'pwd' and it returned a legacyPwd option. Then using -A and -B options got the username for that passwords.

## Exploitation
### SMB Shares
This user did not have PSRemote permissions so I could not get a shell, but it could read some unusual shares.

<img width="1713" height="293" alt="04 - smb shares with thompson" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/276fb135-96c9-4d2c-aa38-f74c112f5f23" />

Inside the Data share I found some log and html files. The one html file revealed that 'TempAdmin' user was deleted but its password was same as Administrator's.

<img width="1374" height="159" alt="05 - TempAdmin" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51901215-aa45-42e8-b0a4-ad0f8db37524" />

### VNC Decrypt
Then again inside the Data share under the s.smith user's directory, found a VNC log file. It included VNC password as HEX value. So I used [this](https://github.com/billchaison/VNCDecrypt) technique to decrypt VNC password and get cleartext of s.smith.

### Evil-WinRM
This user had PSRemote permission. So I got the shell and user flag.

<img width="1328" height="274" alt="08 - got the user" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48934163-3f59-4839-9b83-f60236143469" />

## Lateral Movement
### Checking User
Using 'net user' command, I found out that the user has logon script.

<img width="874" height="561" alt="09 - logon script" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98413bc5-7084-43db-9fb2-4947b987a002" />

So by default, logon scripts are stored in NetLogon share. I connected the share, downloaded the script and analyzed it. It revealed new share called 'Audit$'.

### SQLite
The Audit share contained an SQLite DB. I downloaded that DB and analyzed it. It revealed encrypted password for the ArkSvc user.

<img width="1038" height="504" alt="10 - Audit DB" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0935c756-6116-4c22-9576-a9605e5a7596" />

<img width="661" height="335" alt="11 - ldap encrypted" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cea5c4a4-b51b-4bc6-a1ad-2e5e62603103" />

### Reverse Engineering
The Audit share also included .NET executable and a DLL file. Using ILSpy, I reverse engineered them. It contained Decryption algorithm for the password that I got from the SQLite DB.

<img width="1918" height="875" alt="12 - reversed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9f86b5b-c729-4045-a0fd-aa93ca3c409e" />

<img width="1915" height="1011" alt="13 - reversed dll" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c757a5cf-84dd-4e50-9790-f2880f88c9b2" />

So using the same logic, I applied decryption on cyberchef and got the cleartext password.

## Privilege Escalation
### AD Recycle Bin
The ArkSvc user was in 'AD Recycle Bin' group which has permissions to read properties of deleted objects. (You can checkout [this](https://github.com/ivanversluis/pentest-hacktricks/blob/master/windows/active-directory-methodology/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges.md) site)

So, I ran the command to read the properties of 'TempAdmin' which I know it had same password as Administrator.

### Got The Root
Then simply logged in as Administrator and got the root flag.

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.
