# Jeeves - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial Nmap enumeration revealed open HTTP, SMB and Jetty (50000) Port.

### Directory Brute Force
Applied directory brute force which revealed Jenkins application.

## Exploitation
I could run Jenkins scripts without logging in. So I wrote a groovy reverse shell and got the shell.

Then simply got the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation
Initially I checked current user's privileges. It had SeImpersonatePrivilege, so I thought I could run JuicyPatato. But it did not work.

### Setting Up File Share Server
So I set up an SMB File Share server to share files from windows to linux or vice versa.

### winPEAS
Then transfered winPEAS and ran it. It revealed 'CEH.kdbx' file was available.

### Cracking KDBX
So using 'keepass2john' and then 'john' with 'rockyou.txt' wordlist, I was able to crack the master password.

### Opening KDBX
Then using 'keepass2', I opened the KDBX and got some passwords.

### Getting Shell
All of them instead of Backup Stuff was cleartext passwords. I tried all of them against Administrator user and none of them worked. 
Backup Stuff password was NTLM hash so I though maybe it is Administrator's hash. I ran 'psexec.py' with hashes and got the shell.

### Getting Flag
Initially there was no flag to read. But there was an 'hm.txt' file that says "Look Deeper".

After some research, I learned about alternate data streams. [This](https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/12/16/alternate_data_stream/) post and [this](https://gist.github.com/chriselgee/bf41951d0b51d0ef9d2504a36921cd13) github page explains what is it and how can it be used. So using these informations, I read the alternate stream and got the root flag.

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.
