# Access - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap
Initial Nmap scan revealed HTTP, TELNET and FTP ports.

### FTP Anonymous
There was an FTP anonymous login. Inside the FTP there was '.mdb' file and an encrypted zip file.

### MDB File
'.mdb' is format for legacy Microsoft Access database. I tried to open the file but it did not work, so I did strings and one of the strings seemed like it was a password.

### Unzip Encrypted Zip
So using '7z' I decrypted and unzipped the zip file.

### PST File
Inside the zip there was a PST file. The '.pst' files are files that store the copied of Outlook messages. So I used online '.pst' interpreter and got the password.

But I could also use 'readpst' command line application to read the pst file.

## Exploitation
So the PST file revealed a username and password. I simply connected to telnet and got the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation
Then I set up an SMB Share and tried to run winPEAS.exe which did not work. Then tried to copy reverse shell on the website's directory which also did not work. 
Then I opened windows privilege escalation cheatsheet and started to try one by one. The stored credentials worked.
I ran 'cmdkey /list' to check if there are any stored credentials.

Then using the SMB Share I transfered nc64.exe file.

And then simply used 'runas' application to run nc64 as Administrator and get a reverse shell.

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.
