# Forgotten - Hack The Box

## Enumeration
### Nmap 
Initial nmap scan revealed SSH and HTTP ports were open.

### WEB Enumeration
Website showed 403 Forbidden error.

Directory brute forcing revealed survey endpoint. It was a limesurvey installation endpoint.

When I tried to finish the setup, I was stuck at db connection. Then I thought to create my own database and connect to it remotely. 

I used below commands to set the database and the user. The '%' means from anywhere (0.0.0.0):
```mysql
CREATE DATABASE test_limedb;
CREATE USER 'test_limeuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Test1234';
GRANT SELECT, CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, INDEX ON test_limedb.* TO 'test_limeuser'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Then restarted the db and set the firewall rules:
```bash
sudo ufw allow in on tun0 to anyport 3306
sudo /etc/init.d/mariadb stop
sudo /etc/init.d/mariadb start
```

And I set the database configurations on limesurvey installation.

Then populated the database and set administrator username and password.

Then I simply logged in.

## Exploitation
### CVE-2021-44967
After obtaining admin dashboard, I knew that I could abuse CVE-2021-44967. I could upload malicious plugin and get a reverse shell. [INE post](https://ine.com/blog/cve-2021-44967-limesurvey-rce) explains it in detail.

I could have exploited it manually but I used [this](https://github.com/D3Ext/CVE-2021-44967) tool and got a reverse shell. The reverse shell was in a docker container and there were no flags.

At first I used socat the get an upgraded shell.

Then I run linpeas and found an environment variable which includes limesvc's password.

I was the root inside the container but there were still no flags. Then I tried the SSH login and it worked. I got the user flag on the host machine.

## Privilege Escalation
After some research I found out that, if there was a custom mount on the container I could write to it as container root and execute it as user on the host machine if I host user has access.

So using 'findmnt' I checked available mounts. One of them was a custom mount.

<img width="1132" height="464" alt="16 - read write" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebbd1212-34f5-485e-8045-dcd2236cd024" />

On the host machine, I had access to the mounted directory. 

So as a root on the container, I copied a bash binary to the mount and gave it a SUID privileges.

Then on the host machine I executed it and got the root shell and flag.

## Pwned
The machine was fully compromised.
